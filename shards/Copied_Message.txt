Dear Mr. Griffin,
Of course, we'd be happy to fit you in. I would just like to let you know that our full skin transplantation + facial reconstruction + genetic camouflage + voice recalibration treatment will take about twelve hours and is carried out under full anesthesia. Do not consume alcohol or any psychoactive substances for 48 hours before the procedure.

Thank you and see you soon,
Dr. Jakobsen
