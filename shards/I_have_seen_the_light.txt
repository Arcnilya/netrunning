I know many of my old brothers-in-arms wander this life aimlessly, living hand to mouth while their souls slowly disintegrate with apathy. That is why I am writing this - to provide reassurance. Your purpose is right in front of you - you just haven't perceived it yet.
Today I went through a difficult test, but I came out alive and now my life makes sense again.
It all started with a job from the VDBs - seemed straightforward at first. For an old dog like me it's as easy as aiming and pulling the trigger. I did a quick recon and that same day confirmed mission completion.
Then something strange happened. Instead of receiving my payment, an effervescent light filled my vision, and before me appeared the guardian of the border between the living and the dead.
To my friends who live in destitution - do not lose hope.
The day will come when you too will be put to the test and be given a second chance as I have. Do not waste the opportunity.
Once more we will fight side by side. I am now opening the path to the sacred land with sacrifices to the Loa gods.
Join me!
