somebody feed the cat
he only eats the prescription catscop with tofu'd tuna
the label says "Cat Food"
and you gotta mash it up for him a bit and then stick it in the zapper for exactly 17.5 seconds and if he doesn't eat it then add a little splash of nicola
but be careful, if you add too much nicola he just barfs it right back up
anyway just say pspspsps and he'll come runnin
