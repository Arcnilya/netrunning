Jules,
Please forgive me for how I'm doing this. I'm nowhere near as tough as you and I can't pretend to be anymore. I hate to say it but there's no helping Rose anymore, so at least help yourself before it's too late.
If you change your mind, I'll be waiting for you at Sunset Motel. Think on it again. Please.

Always yours,
Cy
