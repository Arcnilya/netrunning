Dear Sir,
You don't know us, but we know you. Over the past few days we have been closely observing you, unnoticed. We have followed you to your office, to City Hall, to the mall and to that inconspicuous little establishment in Little China opposite the tattoo parlor. We've made some pictures of you entering and leaving... of what you do inside too.
Perhaps you'd be interested in recovering these pictures? I'm sure they'd fit right into your family album. Be at the specified coordinates, alone and unarmed. We will wait for precisely five minutes, otherwise the pictures will be sent to your family and work colleagues.
