My name is Marlon Fuscino. You don't know me. People like you and me don't often cross paths. You work on the top floor of a skyscraper while I pick trash off the curb 100 floors down. But for those rare exceptions where we do it usually ends in tragedy.

Two weeks ago you hit a young woman with your car. The hour was late, it was dark, no one saw a thing. If you had stopped and called for an ambulance she might still be alive. But I guess you had and important meeting over cocktails to get to. That girl bled out on the sidewalk.

Her name was Rosita and she was my daughter. You made me bury her. Ever since she was born I set aside every spare enny I could for her education. But that money won't go to waste. It's all going to a good cause: the hired killer who's going to blow a hole through your arrogant brain.
