[...]For my mother the goddess, silver-footed Thetis, telleth me that twofold fates are bearing me toward the doom of death:
if I abide here and war about the city of the Trojans, then list is my home-return, by my renown shall be imperishable;
but if I return home to my dear native land, lost then is my glorious renown, yet shall my life long endure, neither shall the doom of death come soon upon me.
Aye, and I would counsel you others also to sail back to your homes; seeing there is no more hope that ye shall win the goal of steep Ilios...

Homer
